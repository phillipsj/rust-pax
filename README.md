# PAX

A tool for managing DevOps tooling 

## About
---

I like to keep my Terraform with the source code for the app. I do that by putting an infrastructure folder next to the src folder. Inside of there, I split out by app if there are multiples. I also include tfvars file for each folder. I have included commands for creating the initial infrastructure folder for adding an app or creating modules. Besides Terraform, I use Packer often, so I have included a command that creates my default Packer project structure too. 
 
I hope you enjoy using both. 
 
## Where did the name pax come from? 
---
 
Well, some may already know. Since I wanted an orderly Terraform experiencing, it made me think of Firefly. The Union of Allied Planets used G-23 Paxilon Hydrochlorate, *pax* for short, to calm the populace and introduced it during the Terraforming process. 
 
Since I want a peaceful Terraforming process and I like Firefly the name stuck.
